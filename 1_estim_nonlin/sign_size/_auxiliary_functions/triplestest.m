function [h,p,s] = triplestest(X, alpha)
% TRIPLESTEST - non-parameteric triples test for distributional symmetry (skewness)
%
%   H = TRIPLESTEST(X) performs the non-parametric triples test for
%   symmetry (skewness) of the null hypothesis that the data in X comes
%   from a symmetrical distribution with an unknown median. The test
%   involves the examination of subsets of three variables from X (triples)
%   to determine the likelihood that the distribution is skewed. H==0
%   indicates that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 5%
%   significance level. H==1 indicates that the null hypothesis can be
%   rejected at the 5% level.
%
%   H = TRIPLESTEST(X,ALPHA) performs the test at the significance level
%   (100*ALPHA)%.  ALPHA must  be a scalar between 0 and 1.
%
%   [H,P] = TRIPLESTEST(...) returns the p-value, i.e., the probability of
%   observing the given result, or one more extreme, by chance if the null
%   hypothesis is true.  Small values of P cast doubt on the validity of
%   the null hypothesis.
%
%   [H,P,STATS] = TRIPLESTEST(...) returns a structure STATS with the
%   following fields:
%      'N'       -- number of observations
%      'Ntriples -- number of triples = (N*(N-1)*(N-2))/6
%      'T'       -- statistic (# right - # left triples)
%      'S2'      -- variance
%      'z'       -- test statistic (z-score)
%      'median'  -- median value
%
%   Example:
%
%   % Temperature measurements were obtained by 27 weather stations on a
%   % sunny day in September. Note that temparature is not measured on an
%   % rational scale (a change from 10 to 30 degrees Celsius does not
%   % represent a threefold increase in heat! To see this, express the
%   % temperature in Fahrenheit: 50 to 86 degrees F). The temperatures (in
%   % degrees C) were as follows:
%
%       TEMP = [ 14.9 21.9 21.7 21.4 16.6 23.0 13.7 19.3 15.8 ...
%                16.5 12.3 19.4 22.6 17.3 13.4 14.9 14.5 14.8 ...
%                23.1 13.4 23.1 13.1 14.2 14.1 12.3 17.1 15.4 ] ;
%
%   % A histogram does suggest that the distribution is asymmetric:
%
%        bar(10:2:30,histc(TEMP,10:2:30),'histc') ;
%
%   % To calculate the probablity that the distribution is indeed assymetric
%   % around its median, we apply the triplestest:
%
%        [H, P, S] = triplestest(TEMP)
%        hold on ; plot(S.median([1 1]),[0 10],'r-') ; hold off ; 
%
%   % which yields H = 1 so that we could reject the null-hypothesis that the
%   % temperatures were symmetrically distributed with a significance level
%   % of P = 0.049.
%
%   Notes:
%   - The triples test is more powerful than most alternatives, and yields
%     satisfactory results for samples greater than about 20.
%   - Parametric estimations of distributional (a-)symmetry (such as the
%     3rd central moment) requires a data set that is measured on a
%     rational scale, whereas the non-parametric triples-test can also
%     handle data measured on an ordinal or interval scale (like
%     temperatures).
%   - The triples test is based on the fact that for symmetrical
%     distributions the number of leftward triples equals the number of
%     rightward triples. A leftward or rightward triple is defined as the
%     mean of the triple being smaller or larger than the median of the
%     triple, respectively.
